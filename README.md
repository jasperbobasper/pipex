# pipex - Replicating the Pipe
In this project, I successfully developed a program that allows for seamless command execution and file redirection. 
With pipex, the user is able to process and manipulate data using two shell commands, to replicate the function of `< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2`

Throughout the development process, I focused onerror handling strategies similar to the shell. It took care of file redirection, executed the commands, and redirected the output to the specified output file.

Developing the pipex project improved my understanding of command execution, file redirection, and error management. It gave me a far better understanding of system programming.

## Usage
  - call make 
  - run code with `./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2`
  - Happy pipexing!
